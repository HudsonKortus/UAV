# About
This is the code which runs the UAV. It uses a simple PID loop to determine the amount of torque required to keep the vehicle under control, In order to account for the thrust of the electric ducted fan, I used an equation which calculates the thrust generated by a thrust vane as detailed in <a href="https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/59935">this paper by Jacob Grey Sobering</a>. Quaternions are used to derive the orientation of the UAV from acceleration measurements. I used a closed source quaternion library, so that code is missing from this repository. If you want to use this code, simply add your own orientation code to the angle_output method. This code is over a year old and since writing it, I have greatly improved in my programming abilities. I will soon rewrite the code to be truly object oriented, more compact, and easier to read.

# TODO
 * rewrite code to be more object oriented
 * replace the PID controller with an LQG controller
